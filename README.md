Save Dogs

****Volunteers, shelters, and new dog families meet here!****
Save Dogs is a project aimed at facilitating the adoption of stray dogs from South Korea to overseas countries. Our service connects volunteer transporters with dog shelters, ensuring a safe and reliable journey for the rescued dogs.

****Product Overview****
In South Korea, there is a significant number of stray dogs in need of homes. However, finding suitable adopters locally can be challenging. Save Dogs addresses this issue by coordinating international adoptions. We match volunteer transporters who are traveling to specific destinations with dog shelters that have dogs ready for adoption.

****Features****

Shelter-Volunteer Matching: Shelters can list dogs available for adoption, including their profiles, photos, and medical histories. Transporters can search for shelters in their destination country and choose dogs to transport based on their preferences.

Easy communication: Once a transporter and shelter are matched, they can communicate and make arrangements through our platform. Transporters can update the status of the journey, allowing shelters and adopters to track the dog's progress via an in-app real-time chat feature.

Reliable Community and Reviews: Our service includes a community section where transporters, shelters, and adopters can share their experiences, provide feedback, and support each other in the adoption process.
