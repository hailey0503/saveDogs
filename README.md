Save Dogs üê∫

****Volunteers, shelters, and new dog families meet here!****
Save Dogs is a project aimed at facilitating the adoption of stray dogs from South Korea to overseas countries. Our service connects volunteer transporters with dog shelters, ensuring a safe and reliable journey for the rescued dogs.

****Product Overview****
In South Korea, there is a significant number of stray dogs in need of homes. However, finding suitable adopters locally can be challenging. Save Dogs addresses this issue by coordinating international adoptions. We match volunteer transporters who are traveling to specific destinations with dog shelters that have dogs ready for adoption.

****Features****

Shelter-Volunteer Matching: Shelters can list dogs available for adoption, including their profiles, photos, and medical histories. Transporters can search for shelters in their destination country and choose dogs to transport based on their preferences.

Easy communication: Once a transporter and shelter are matched, they can communicate and make arrangements through our platform. Transporters can update the status of the journey, allowing shelters and adopters to track the dog's progress via an in-app real-time chat feature.

Reliable Community and Reviews: Our service includes a community section where transporters, shelters, and adopters can share their experiences, provide feedback, and support each other in the adoption process.

Technologies Used & System Architecture
The Save Dogs project utilizes the following technologies:

Next.js application with Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Google Maps API, Vercel, Docker, and AWS EC2 might look like the following:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Next.js: React-based framework for server-rendered React applications.
   - Google Maps API: Integration for interactive map features.

2. **Backend:**
   - Node.js: Server-side runtime for building scalable network applications.
   - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
   - Firebase: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions.

3. **Deployment and Hosting:**
   - Vercel: Deploy Next.js applications with ease and continuous deployment.
   - Docker: Containerization for easy deployment and scaling.
   - AWS EC2: Virtual server instances for hosting backend services.

**System Flow:**
1. Frontend is built using Next.js, which allows for server-side rendering and improves the user experience with faster page loads.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend, which is powered by Node.js, using RESTful APIs or GraphQL for data exchange.
3. MongoDB stores and retrieves data for various features of the application, providing a scalable and flexible database solution.
4. Firebase handles user authentication and real-time data synchronization, ensuring a smooth user experience.
5. Google Maps API is integrated into the frontend to provide interactive map features for users.
6. Vercel is used for hosting and deploying the frontend application, providing automatic deployment with GitHub integration.
7. Docker allows for easy containerization of the backend services, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.
8. For more complex backend requirements or long-running tasks, some services can be deployed on AWS EC2 instances for scalability and performance.
