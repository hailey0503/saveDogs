Backend
The backend folder contains the Node.js backend for the project. It is built using the Express framework and utilizes Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. The backend handles the business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.

To set up the backend, navigate to the backend folder and follow the instructions below:

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.

Configure the MongoDB connection by editing the .env file and providing the appropriate values for your MongoDB server.

Once the dependencies are installed, and the MongoDB connection is configured, start the backend server with the following command:

Copy code
node server.js
This will start the backend server and make it accessible at http://localhost:8000.
